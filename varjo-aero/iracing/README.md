### *!!! Make sure to check base configuration for your [headset](../README.md) !!!*


We're aiming at slightly below 90 fps in demanding situations - like being in the middle of the grid and driving past the pits. 

## Graphics settings

All settings are done in `rendererDX11.ini` or via the UI.

The following setting fix the warping problem.

```
[OpenVR]
FixGetProjectionRawBug=1                        	; Might help fix vertical eye alignment issues
```

These are the settings in the UI.
