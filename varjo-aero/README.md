# Varjo Aero

Hardware specs:

```
Dual Mini LED LCD; 2880 x 2720 px per eye
Brightness: Calibrated to 150 NIT
Colors: Calibrated with coverage of 99% sRGB, 95% DCI-P3
Refresh rate: 90Hz 
```

## Varjo Base

The resolution quality setting will adjust what Steam sees as 100% resolution.
We need to render at a higher resolution than the panel, because we'll loose some
when projecting the image to compensate for the distortion of the lenses.

The **high** setting at 35 PPD is the default. Anything above will be supersampling and if
we want to do that, we'll do so in SteamVR on a per application basis.

## SteamVR settings

The Varjo Base **high** setting results in a resolution of `3140x2692` for steam at `100%`.
A medium setting would be `2732x2340`
